            One method that will help you learn about vectors is creating an
            image <br> of the problem using grid paper or graph paper. 
            <br> This approach creates a picture that we can use to help us make measurements 
            <br> related to the vector.
            <br><br>
                <div id="intro">
                    The two main attributes of any vector are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The <span style="text-decoration: underline">Length of the vector</span>
                            <br>
                            This length is called the "Magnitude" of the vector.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            The direction a vector is going.
                            <br>
                            To measure this we use <span style="text-decoration: underline">the degrees of the angle</span> in which the vector is pointing,
                            <br>
                            or the angle between two vectors that share a common point. 
                            <br>
                            This angle is called the "Direction Angle". 
                            <br><br>
                            If two rays are joined at one point, called the vertex of the angle, 
                            the degrees of the angle can easily be measured. This is called the 
                            "Direction Angle".
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/angle.png" alt="angle pic" id="angleImage" />
                    An 'angle' in Geometry is classified based upon its degrees. 
                    Vectors are included under the same classifications.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        acute angle
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        right angle
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        obtuse angle
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        straight angle
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        reflex angle
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        OR any angle with a degree between 0°-360°
                    </li>

            Let's break our problem down into its two seperate measurements: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Length, called the "Magnitude",
            </li>
            <li>
                The angle of the vector, called the "Direction Angle".
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            First, let's begin with how to calculate the "Magnitude", or length of a vector.
            <br><br>
            In Algebra 1, you learned how to calculate the missing side length of a Right Triangle. 
            We will create a right triangle out of our vector and calculate the lengths of the legs of 
            the right triangle by counting how many boxes long each side is. 
            <br>
            Then, we will calculate the vector's length using Pythagorean Theorem. Any vector's 
            magnitude can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem.   
        </p>
        <p id='intro'>
            The Pythagorean Theorem
            <br>
            a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            So, let's review how to complete the first calculation. 
            <br> 
            The first thing you want to do is sketch the vector on your graph paper using the 
            coordinates of two points that lie on the vector. 
            Then, you can sketch a right triangle using the vector and sketching the two sides that 
            form the 90° angle. I will use images from above to help guide you.

        In summary, the length of a vector can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem.
    </p>
    <p id="directionAngle2"> 
        Calculating the Direction Angle of a Vector
    </p>
    <p>
        To calculate the Direction Angle of a Vector,  use Trigonometry functions 
        SIN, COS, AND TAN to calculate the degrees of any angle inside your right triangle.
        The angle you pick to calculate will be the angle related to what information you need 
        as part of the problem.
        <br><br>
        Remember the Triangle Sum Rule states that the three interior angles of any triangle add 
        to equal 180°. You can use this rule to help you solve for the angles inside the triangle. 
        You must still use Trig to solve for the first angle. Then use Triangle Sum to solve for the
        other angle. Don't forget that there is a 90° angle (by design) inside of your triangle.

        Vectors are easy to work with if you incorporate your knowledge about Geometry
        and polygons (their properties), the Pythagorean Theorem, and Trig Functions. Also thinking 
        of a vector as a ray helps you to learn the concepts of vectors easier.
        <br>
        Vectors are introduced in Geometry, but remain a important part of the advanced maths.
